## Riso Color Sandbox // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/riso_color_sandbox/)

A quick and dirty sandbox for discovering new riso color combinations. Honestly, I've built and published this so that I can quickly experiment with colors wherever I happen to be. Mine is customized to the SVA RisoLAB's 11 color drums. Feel free to fork and adjust [risolab_colors.js](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/blob/master/riso_color_sandbox/risolab_colors.js) to your needs!

For saving your colors experiments:
- Press "i" to save the sandbox as is
- Press "s" to save each separate riso color layer
- Check out the [samples](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/blob/master/riso_color_sandbox/samples/) folder for example outputs!
