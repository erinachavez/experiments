## Image Manipulations // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/image_manipulation/)

A simple experiment in manipulating an image along random grid lines&mdash; created to be printed as a risograph. For that reason, you may have to zoom out in your browser, when viewing the live example. to properly view the images generated. I've attached photos of some sample outputs and my riso print below! Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Printed at the SVA's [RisoLAB](https://risolab.sva.edu).
