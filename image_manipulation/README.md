## Image Manipulations // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/image_manipulation/index.html)

A simple experiment in manipulating an image along random grid lines&mdash; created to be printed as a risograph. I've attached photos of some sample outputs and my riso print below! Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Print at the SVA's [RisoLAB](https://risolab.sva.edu).

**Sample Outputs:**
