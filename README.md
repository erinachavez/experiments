- [Maze iOS Game](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/maze_ios_game)
  - My first experiment into creating a mobile game app &mdash;a basic maze tilt game!
  - Built with Unity (C#), deployed with Xcode
- [Pattern Generator](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/pattern_generator) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/pattern_generator/)
  - A quick and dirty experiment for generating random, but tileable, patterns. Refresh the page for endless patterns!
  - Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
- [Perlin Rings](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/perlin_rings) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/perlin_rings/)
  - A quick program I built in hopes of utilizing for a screen printing project &mdash; see the [project's README](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/perlin_rings) for instructions on how to generate your own perlin rings!
  - Built with [Processing](https://processing.org), translated with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for web use
- [p5.riso Pilot](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/riso_pilot)
  - An excited initial jump into the world of :sparkles:bot risography:sparkles: thanks to [antiboredom's p5.riso library](https://github.com/antiboredom/p5.riso)
- [Random Tesselations](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/tesselations) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/tesselations/)
  - I have been wanting to test an idea for a little while on randomly generating tesselating tiles... :stars:
  - Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and borrowed a function from [math.js](https://mathjs.org).
- [Image Manipulations](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/image_manipulation) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/image_manipulation/)
  - A simple experiment in manipulating an image along random grid lines&mdash; created to be printed as a risograph
  - You may have to zoom out in your browser to properly view the images generated!
  - Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Printed at the SVA's [RisoLAB](https://risolab.sva.edu).
- [Four-Way Grid Distortion](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/four_grid_distortion) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/four_grid_distortion/)
  - Inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/f1fXCRtSUWU), I created a digital version of the same concept - and then printed it as part of a riso booklet!
  - You can see the full booklet and adapted code here: [https://github.com/erinachavez/riso_booklet](https://github.com/erinachavez/riso_booklet)
  - Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
- [Riso Color Sandbox](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/riso_color_sandbox) // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/riso_color_sandbox/)
  - A quick and dirty sandbox for discovering new riso color combinations. Mine is customized to the SVA RisoLAB's 11 color drums. Feel free to fork and adjust [risolab_colors.js](https://github.com/erinachavez/experiments/tree/master/riso_color_sandbox/risolab_colors.js) to your needs!
