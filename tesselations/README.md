## Random Tesselations

I have been wanting to test an idea for a little while on randomly generating tesselating tiles. The initial experiment has been a success :stars: Excited to adapt this further to produce even crazier shapes with more vertices, and possibly even curves! Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and borrowed a function from [math.js](https://mathjs.org).
