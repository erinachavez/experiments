## Four-Way Grid Distortion // [Live Example](https://erinachavez.github.io/experiments/four_grid_distortion/)

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1fXCRtSUWU&feature=youtu.be), I created a digital version of the same concept - and then printed it as part of a riso booklet! I'll publish a version of the same experiment I adapted to be print ready in the near future.
