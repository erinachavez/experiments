## Extract Album Colors

I thought this was a pretty successful python experiment, so I'm saving it down to a slightly more reliable computer.

A mini application for searching albums and extracting a color from its cover. Built with python 3; utilizes [Spotify's API](https://github.com/spotify/web-api), [colorgram](https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py), and [flat](https://github.com/xxyxyz/flat).

**Sample Outputs:**
